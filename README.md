# boot-test-cljs

**Work in Progress**

## Usage

Not yet published. Clone this repository and do `boot build-jar`.

Then, either include `pandeiro/boot-test-cljs` in any Boot project (or
use the example directory, included in the repo):

```
boot test-cljs -n app.tests # replace app.tests w/ your tests ns
```

## How it works

### HtmlUnit-based browser tests

1. Generates scaffolding for test compilation and HTML page to host it
2. Compiles tests
3. Serves page with tests
4. Connects to page with HtmlUnit and executes tests
5. Captures tests results from page and disconnects

### Nashorn-based tests

WIP

### External program (phantomjs, Node.js, etc) tests

WIP
